# FoodFlation

FoodFlation is a website made with NextJS, NodeJS, Express, Puppeteer, and MySQL to track prices of everyday grocery store items in real time in your local grocery stores.

Due to several economic issues we are seeing record inflation globally, especially in grocery stores. Inflation has never been this high since in the 1980s! FoodFlation is made with the intent to closely gauge and monitor the prices to properly gauge the magnitude of inflation in grocery store.

FoodFlation is made to help consumers both understand the true extent of inflation, as well as navigating through it by finding the cheapest prices.
