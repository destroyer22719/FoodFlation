# [FoodFlation](https://foodflation.me)

FoodFlation is a website made with NextJS, NodeJS, Express, Puppeteer, and MySQL to track prices of everyday grocery store items in real time in your local grocery store.

Due to supply issues caused by the pandemic (and possibly a myrad of other explaination by people) we are seeing record inflation, especially in grocery stores since in the 1980s! FoodFlation is made with the intent to closely gauge and monitor the prices to properly gauge the magnitude of inflation in grocery store. Inflation in food prices will hurt working class people the most.

The website is still in its early stages, feedback is highly encouraged! You can email me or submit an issue if you have any feedback, bug reports, or questions.
